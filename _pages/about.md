<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/), [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the same department under the supervision of [Richard Moffitt](https://med.emory.edu/departments/hematology-medical-oncology/profile/?u=RAMOFFI). I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) under the supervision of [Steve Skiena](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/StevenSkiena). During my research focused Masters, I worked with [Bernard Moret](https://people.epfl.ch/bernard.moret) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/). My undergraduate degree in Computer Science is from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/).

I am a computational biologist who works at the intersection of computer science, genetics, and statistics. I am interested in the development of new algorithms and computational methods that aid in the advances of precision medicine, with the potential to address existing racial disparities in health data. My current research projects include precise compartment deconvolution and weight estimation of mixed tissue samples, analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, methods for small size differential expression studies, and applied machine learning.

If you are a student at Stony Brook and want to work with me, please [send me email](https://ayurovsky.github.io/contact) to arrange an appointment.
