As an [IDEA Fellow](href='https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/idea-fellows-join-stony-brook-faculty' target='_blank'), I am a new faculty member at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/' target='_blank'>Department of Biomedical Informatics</a>, <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.stonybrook.edu/' target='_blank'>Stony Brook University</a>".

I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [BMI Department](https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/) at the [Stony Brook University School of Medicine](https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/) and a recipient of the [NSF/CRA Computing Innovation Fellowship](https://cifellows2020.org/2020-class/) for research on precise compartment deconvolution and weight estimation of mixed tissue samples. I am currently advised by [Richard Moffitt](https://med.emory.edu/departments/hematology-medical-oncology/profile/?u=RAMOFFI).

I completed my PhD at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) under the supervision of [Steve Skiena](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/StevenSkiena). During my research focused Masters, I worked with [Bernard Moret](https://people.epfl.ch/bernard.moret) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/). My undergraduate degree in Computer Science is from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/).

I am a computational biologist who works at the intersection of computer science, genetics, and statistics. I am interested in the development of new algorithms and computational methods that aid in the advances of precision medicine, with the potential to address existing racial disparities in health data. I am also interested in algorithms for synthetic gene design and analysis methods for small size differential expression studies, with the goals for advancing vaccine design and promoting diverse and inclusive research.
